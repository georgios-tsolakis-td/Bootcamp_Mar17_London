## Audience Survey

Before starting the presentation, I would like you to participate in a short interactive survey. This will help me to know you better and to structure the presentation accordingly.

## A Trivial Example      
```{r}
fluidRow(
  column(width = 6,
         renderDataTable(select(iris, Species, Petal.Length, Sepal.Length, everything()),options = list(pageLength = 5))
  ),
  column(width = 6,
         renderPlotly({
           plot_ly(iris, x= ~Sepal.Length, y=~Petal.Length, color = ~Species, colors = "Set1", size = ~Petal.Width, type = "scatter", mode = "markers",
                   text = ~paste('Petal Width(size):', Petal.Width)) %>% 
             layout(title = "Petal Length vs Sepal Length vs Petal Width", xaxis = list(title = "Sepal Length"), yaxis = list(title = "Petal Length"))
         })
  )
)
```

## Our Capabilities

- In most of our projects we end up delivering a [Shiny App](https://shiny.rstudio.com) to our clients

- [Aster](http://www.teradata.co.uk/products-and-services/analytics-from-aster-overview/?LangType=2057&LangSelect=true) has very impressive `npath` functions

- [Kylo](https://kylo.io) provides visualisation support to discover metadata and monitor feeds

- For Enedis we created a Tableau dashboard to get initial insights of all the datasets loaded in Aster

- We are building a new package to help R Shiny users to build amazing visualisations on the fly - `plotbuildR`


## Viz Trends: [APACHE LIVY](http://livy.io/index.html)

- An Open Source REST Service for Apache Spark

- A service that manages long running Spark Contexts in your cluster

- Helps to reduce friction to use Spark

- Submitting a job, getting back results, getting spark context

- Client API in java, scala, python and now, also in R

## Powerful Deliverables

- [Trains Demo](http://ec2-52-208-145-120.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com/shiny/trains)

- [Vodafone: Campaign Evaluation App ]()

## Interactive Visualisation Made Easy

- To make powerful visualisations easy for R users, we have developed a new package called *plotbuildR*

- You'll be able to try and test different plots within your Shiny App on the fly

- Possiblity to plot 14 different interactive graphs
